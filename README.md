# PythonProjects:

# Clock Project

This project uses the `turtle` graphics library in Python to create simple graphical applications. It demonstrates how to set up a window, draw shapes, and implement animations using the Turtle module.

## Features
- Basic setup of the Turtle window
- Drawing shapes and figures
- Time-based animation using the `time` module

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You will also need the `turtle` library (which is included by default with most Python installations).

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone 
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd turtle-project
    ```

3. Run the Python script:
    ```
    python turtle_project.py
    ```

## Usage

Once you have the project set up and running, the Turtle graphics window will open. The script will draw a shape or perform an animation based on the logic defined in the code.
